# Forge-Squared

This is my self-hosted website used to design your own crafting systems. 
It is a static-content type website using Node JS, with no backend whatsoever. Files are generated in browser client-side, so there's no need to send data to a server.
Also, don't expect the website to be up 100% of the time. Don't even expect it to be up 20% of the time, at least until it's done.
I plan to eventually host it on a Raspberry Pi.
